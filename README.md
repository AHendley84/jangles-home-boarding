# Jangles Home Boarding, Walking & Day Care Website
Jangles Home Boarding, Walking & Day Care is a small, independent business in Caerphilly, South Wales that was established in 2014. It provides a home from home experience for your dog and goes the extra mile to ensure that your dog has the best time possible during their stay. It is a service me and my wife have used for 7 years with our two dogs, so we have first-hand experience of how wonderful the service is and how well the dogs are treated. The business is heavily active on social media, however, they have not had a website for a number of years. I believe that a well designed and informative website will be an invaluable tool in providing useful information to new and existing customers whilst promoting the brand.
