# Jangles Home Boarding, Walking & Day Care Website
Jangles Home Boarding, Walking & Day Care is a small, independent business in Caerphilly, South Wales that was established in 2014. It provides a home from home experience for your dog and goes the extra mile to ensure that your dog has the best time possible during their stay. It is a service me and my wife have used for 7 years with our two dogs, so we have first-hand experience of how wonderful it is and how well the dogs are treated. The business is heavily active on social media, however, they have not had a website for a number of years. I believe that a well-designed and informative website will be an invaluable tool in providing useful information to new and existing customers whilst promoting the brand.

### Manual Testing and Results
### User Story Tetsing
### Lighthouse Test
Each pages has been tested on mobile and desktop with the following table dsiaplying the results:

|Page|Device|Lighthouse Results|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|Index  |Mobile |![Index Mobile Results](documentation/index_mobile_performance.png)|74 Performance score is due to images not being in next-gen format and render-blocking resources (Bootstrap)|
|Index  |Desktop |![Index Desktop Results](documentation/index_desktop_performance.png)||
|About  |Mobile |![About Mobile Results](documentation/about_mobile_performance.png)|81 Performance score is due to images not being in next-gen format and render-blocking resources (Bootstrap)|
|About  |Desktop |![About Desktop Results](documentation/about_desktop_performance.png)||
|Gallery  |Mobile |![Gallery Mobile Results](documentation/gallery_mobile_performance.png)||

|Thank You  |Desktop |![Thank You Desktop Results](documentation/thankyou_desktop_performance.png)||

**- As noted, the performance scores for some of the mobile pages drop to an average of 83. As the same issues are flagged, images not in a next-gen format and render-blocking resources, future builds of the website can look to move away from dependance on Bootstrap for some features and changing images to possible WebP or AVIF file types.**

### Responsiveness
### Bugs
- When setting up the contact form I was unable to align the submit button within a DIV to the center. I tried a few methods I thought would work with no such luck. A Google search provided the answer and the following code resolved the issue:
```css
.button_position {
    display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;
}
```
Acknowledged in the credits section for the assitance provided.

- I was experiencing side-scroll on the mobile version of the contact page. The input boxes were exceeding the width of the screen and causing the side scroll.  I added the following code to my CSS targeting the form and this seems to have resolved the issue:
```css
max-width: 300px;
```
However, I believe this to be a temporary solution to one problem as the input boxes still expand to the maximum width of the container. I'll look to amend this in a further update where the information this page expands from a single column on mobile to 3 columns on desktop in a future update.
