# Jangles Home Boarding, Walking & Day Care Website
Jangles Home Boarding, Walking & Day Care is a small, independent business in Caerphilly, South Wales that was established in 2014. It provides a home from home experience for your dog and goes the extra mile to ensure that your dog has the best time possible during their stay. It is a service me and my wife have used for 7 years with our two dogs, so we have first-hand experience of how wonderful it is and how well the dogs are treated. The business is heavily active on social media, however, they have not had a website for a number of years. I believe that a well-designed and informative website will be an invaluable tool in providing useful information to new and existing customers whilst promoting the brand.

### Bugs
- When setting up the contact form I was unable to align the submit button within a DIV to the center. I tried a few methods I thought would work with no such luck. A Google search provided the answer and the following code resolved the issue:
```css
.button_position {
    display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;
}
```
Acknowledged in the credits section for the assitance provided.

- I was experiencing side-scroll on the mobile version of the contact page. The input boxes were exceeding the width of the screen and causing the side scroll.  I added the following code to my CSS targeting the form and this seems to have resolved the issue:
```css
max-width: 300px;
```
However, I believe this to be a temporary solution to one problem as the input boxes still expand to the maximum width of the container. I'll look to amend this in a further update where the information this page expands from a single column on mobile to 3 columns on desktop in a future update.
